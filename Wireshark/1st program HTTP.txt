    Congratulations again!  Now you've downloaded the file lab2-2.html. <br>\n
    This file's last modification date will not change.  <p>\n
    Thus  if you download this multiple times on your browser, a complete copy <br>\n
    will only be sent once by the server due to the inclusion of the IN-MODIFIED-SINCE<br>\n
    field in your browser's HTTP GET request to the server.\n

9)<-Hypertext Transfer Protocol ---->HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
The HTTP status code returned from the server in response to the second HTTP GET is "200 OK".

The server returned a "200 OK" status code, indicating that the request was successful, and the server is explicitly returning the contents of the file. This is confirmed by the presence of the "Content-Length" header in the response, which specifies the size of the content being returned (371 bytes). Additionally, there is no indication in the response that the server is providing a "304 Not Modified" status code, which would indicate that the content hasn't been modified since the specified date/time. Therefore, the server explicitly returned the contents of the file in response to the second HTTP GET request.
